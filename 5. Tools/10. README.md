# Tools

This folder stores a set of software solutions that add new features to the testing environment. These software solutions run in processes that are independent from the user program and from each other, so that an error or unexpected behavior during the execution of one process does not force the other programs to suddenly stop running.

Information about each tool can be found in the [tools.pdf]() file. Examples of the employment of these tools during the validation of control and navigation algorithms can be found in the [examples]() directory.

# Modules

This section stores the modules of the UAV class that is used to represent real and simulated vehicles. The UAV class encapsulates the up to date state of the vehicle and the methods that enable communication with the PX4 autopilot of the drone. By dealing with the complexity associated with the communication with the drone, the UAV class enables the rapid validation of navigation and control algorithms in the ISR Flying Arena.

Detailed information of this class can be found in the [documentation.pdf]() file, available in this repository. Dozens of examples of offboard programs that employ these modules to effortlessly test guidance, navigation, and control algorithms can be found in the [examples]() folder.

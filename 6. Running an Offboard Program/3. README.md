# Running an Offboard Program

This folder stored the offboard launcher.sh program that automatically starts all the required processes to perform an experiment, further reducing the difficulty involved in using the real and the simulation environments of the ISR Flying Arena.

Information about this tool can be found in the [launching_offboard_programs.pdf]() file. Dozens of examples of offboard programs that are launched with this Bash executable can be found in the [examples]() folder.

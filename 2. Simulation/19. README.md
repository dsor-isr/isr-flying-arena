# Simulation

Simulators allow testing of navigation and control solutions in a quick and safe way. Before attempting to fly real vehicles in the ISR Flying Arena, it is recommended to use the simulator to ensure that the estimation and control algorithms are working properly and the vehicles are behaving as expected. This is a key measure to guarantee the safety of users and equipment.


### Launching the simulator

To launch a simulation, a user only has to perform two steps:

1. Edit the **gazebo.launch** file according to the configurations desired for Gazebo, for the simulated vehicles, and for the PX4 SITL instances.

```bash
gedit ~/Simulation/gazebo.launch
```

2. Run the **simulator** executable.

```bash
source ~/Simulation/simulator.sh
```

The [simulation.pdf]() file, available in this folder, contains all the information needed to correctly configure simulations. Additionally, in the [examples]() directory, the user can find the gazebo.launch files used to set up dozens of experiments.


### Path for important folders

For changing advanced settings of the simulation, the user needs to add or modify files in the following three paths:

1. To add new Gazebo worlds or edit the existing ones: **~/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds**

2. To add new vehicle models or modify the existing ones: **~/Firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/rotors_description/urdf**

3. To add or change the files with the internal configurations of the PX4 autopilot: **~/Firmware/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/**

Additionally, users can adjust the noise added to the true position an attitude of the drones in the emulated MOCAP software program, by editing the following file:

```bash
gedit ~/catkin_ws_python/src/mocap/src/mocap_config.yaml
```

# Installation Manual

A complete installation guide of all the software required to perform experiments in the ISR Flying Arena is presented below. It is assumed that the computer is running **Ubuntu 18.04** as its operating system. If installation problems arise, consult the links suggested at each step.


### Installing Gazebo, ROS and MAVROS

1. Download and run the bash script available in the PX4 Developer Guide:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PX4/Devguide/master/build_scripts/ubuntu_sim_ros_melodic.sh
source ubuntu_sim_ros_melodic.sh
```

2. Install the following Python libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev python3-empy python3-jinja2 python3-toml python3-pip
```

For troubleshooting purposes, consult the [official installation instructions](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html#rosgazebo) provided by the PX4 Developer Guide.


### Installing MAVSDK C++

1. Download the **deb** file for Ubuntu 18.04 from [MAVSDK releases](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/releases).

2. Install it using one of the following commands:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i mavsdk_0.34.0_ubuntu18.04_amd64.deb
```

For troubleshooting purposes, consult the [official instructions](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/develop/en/cpp/quickstart.html) from the MAVSDK website.


### Installing MAVSDK Python

* To install the MAVSDK Python library, simply run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
pip3 install mavsdk
```

For troubleshooting purposes, consult the [official instructions](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python) from the MAVSDK Python repository.


### Cloning the PX4 Firmware

* In order to clone the PX4 Firmware, to either upload it to the physical board or to perform simulations in the computer, run the following line of code in the terminal:

```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/PX4/Firmware.git --recursive
```
For troubleshooting purposes, consult the [official instructions](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/building_px4.html#get_px4_code) provided by the PX4 Developer Guide.


### Installing QGroundControl 

1. The QGroundControl is an intuitive ground control station for the MAVLink protocol. To successfully install it, first run in the terminal:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo apt-get remove modemmanager -y
```

2. Then logout, login again and download the [QGroundControl.AppImage](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qgroundcontrol/latest/QGroundControl.AppImage). Finally, install and run the QGroundControl using the following commands in the directory of the downloaded image:

```bash
chmod +x ./QGroundControl.AppImage
./QGroundControl.AppImage  (or double-click)
```

For troubleshooting purposes, consult the [official installation instructions](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html) from the QGroundControl User Guide.


### Cloning this repository

* To clone this repository, simply run the following command:

```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://tiagoalexnd@bitbucket.org/dsorglobal/tiagooliveira.git
```


### Running the final installation script

* To finish the installation process, run the bash script available in this folder, that will configure the ROS workspaces and install the last remaining software programs and libraries:

```bash
cd "~/tiagooliveira/1. Installation" && source "1. installation.sh"
```


### First run of the simulator

* To make sure that the installation process was successful, run the Gazebo simulator for the first time. Do not skip this step.

```bash
cd ~/Firmware && make px4_sitl gazebo
```
